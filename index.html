	<b> Why I Chose Mikrokosmos</b>
  <br> BTS new album Map of the Soul: Persona was released on April 12, 2019. Even though I love all there song, Mikrokosmos in particularly stood out to me the most because of the melody and meaning behind them. I love the meaning behind their title Mikrokosmos meaning small world. To me I feel like is more of a love song, and it seems like they might be using the word to mean how one person in a world of 7 billion can seem so small, but mean so much. Their album scored third NO.1 album on Billboard 200 Chart.

	<b> Hashmap</b>
  <br> The reason why I chose HashMap is because it requires a small constant number of random accesses to main memory, irrespective of the size of the table, or the length of its keys.

	<b> Data Visualization Technique</b>
  <br> The reason why I chose this data visualization is because it coincides with the song title and the meaning behind it. The song is talking about love and even though there are billions of people in this world the only special person to him is that one person. That is why my word cloud is shaped as a heart and many different colors representing the beautiful feelings.
